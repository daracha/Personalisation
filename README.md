### Introduction
This is the part-1 of a semster long course project for the course "Personalization Theory and application" by Brett Vintch at Columbia University.

a movie recommendation service. It contains 100004 ratings and 1296 tag applications across 9125 movies. 
These data were created by 671 users between January 09, 1995 and October 16, 2016. 
This dataset was generated on October 17, 2016.

This dataset is sampled from a larger dataset where users were selected at random for inclusion. All selected users had rated at least 20 movies.

### Approach
1. Data cleaning and exploration
1. Using Packages to build the following models
